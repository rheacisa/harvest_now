Subject: Interactive Quantum Cryptography Demo - Portfolio Project

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share my latest portfolio project demonstrating advanced 
cybersecurity concepts:

🔗 Live Demo: https://harvestnow.streamlit.app
💻 GitHub: https://github.com/rheacisa/harvest_now

This interactive application demonstrates:
• The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" quantum threat
• How Shor's algorithm can break RSA encryption
• Post-Quantum Cryptography solutions (ML-KEM/Kyber)
• Security best practices (OWASP guidelines, input validation, CSPRNG)

The project showcases skills in:
- Python development
- Cryptographic systems
- Web application security
- NIST standards compliance
- Privacy-by-design architecture

I've implemented production-grade security features including input 
validation, output sanitization, and zero data collection.

Feel free to explore the live demo and review the code on GitHub!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### ✅ Cover Letter:
```
"I recently developed a quantum threat demonstrator (harvestnow.streamlit.app) 
that showcases the 'Harvest Now, Decrypt Later' attack and demonstrates 
Post-Quantum Cryptography solutions. This project implements NIST-standardized 
algorithms and follows OWASP security best practices, including cryptographically 
secure random number generation, input validation, and privacy-by-design 
architecture."
```

## How to Present in Interviews:

### Technical Discussion Points:
1. **Cryptographic Security**: "I used CSPRNG instead of random.random() for all key generation"
2. **Input Validation**: "Implemented bounds checking to prevent resource exhaustion attacks"
3. **Error Handling**: "Graceful error handling without information leakage"
4. **Privacy**: "Zero data collection, no cookies, stateless architecture"
5. **Standards**: "Followed NIST PQC standards and OWASP guidelines"

### Business Value Discussion:
1. "Demonstrates understanding of emerging quantum computing threats"
2. "Shows ability to implement complex cryptographic concepts"
3. "Educational tool that can help organizations understand PQC migration urgency"
4. "Combines technical depth with accessible explanations for non-technical audiences"

## Testing Checklist Before Interviews:

- [ ] Visit https://harvestnow.streamlit.app/ 
- [ ] Click through all demo buttons
- [ ] Verify simple demo works
- [ ] Verify technical demo works
- [ ] Check that RSA-KEM demo loads
- [ ] Test quantum attack simulation
- [ ] Test PQC protection demo
- [ ] Review security features in sidebar
- [ ] Check that it looks professional

## Backup Plan:

If the site is down during an interview:
1. Have screenshots ready
2. Can demo locally: `streamlit run web_demo.py`
3. Can run command-line demos: `python simple_demo.py`
4. GitHub code is always available as backup
